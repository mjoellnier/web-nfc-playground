# Web-NFC Playground

Google Chrome announced the [Web NFC API](https://web.dev/nfc/) for their origin trial in Chrome 81. I created this PWA ready ReactJS App to test the basic functionality with this awesome API. It is for pure testing purposes and in no means production ready - especially as the API is on Google Chrome origin trial.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
