# Web-NFC Playground

Google Chrome announced the [Web NFC API](https://web.dev/nfc/) for their origin trial in Chrome 81. I created this PWA ready ReactJS App to test the basic functionality with this awesome API. It is for pure testing purposes and in no means production ready - especially as the API is on Google Chrome origin trial.

You can launch the app via [this link](https://mjoellnier.github.io/web-nfc-playground). It is recommended you do so via a NFC capable device like your mobilephone.

## What can I do with this PWA?

- You can scan NFC tags and see whats stored on it
- You can write a text message on a NFC tag (UTF-8 encoded with your browser language)
- You can write an URL on a NFC tag

Feedback is welcomed as always! You can reach out for me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coding_max)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
